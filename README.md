# Personal-Site-Revised
This is a second version of my Personal Site

My first version which you should be able to view from the projects folder was made in React JS and for this one I wanted to go back to basics with HTML and SASS
to keep it simple. Design wise I went with a more simpler approach as I'm still early in my Development career and I figured it's best to keep the design of the
site minimal and I'll add more content to it as I continue my career.
